This report details the development of a weather forecasting model using the "Global Weather Repository" dataset from Kaggle. The workflow includes data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model construction to predict temperature ('temperature_celsius'). The report covers data handling (missing value imputation, outlier management, normalization), exploratory analysis (correlations, trends, seasonal patterns, time-series decomposition), and model building using an XGBoost Regressor, including feature encoding, training, and evaluation.
